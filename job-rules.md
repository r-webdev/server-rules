Our Job Board platform #job-postings demands that all users read, acknowledge, and abide by the following regulations to ensure a space of absolute professionalism and seriousness for all involved parties.

# Job Board Rules

1. Job Titles: Descriptive job titles including the job seeker's title (e.g., Frontend Developer, QA Engineer) and type of employment (e.g., Fulltime, Freelance, Contract, Gig) are expected.

2. Job Descriptions: Clear and concise job descriptions are required, highlighting the job type, detailed skill requirements, and providing a comprehensive overview of the tasks involved. Vagueness should be avoided, and job descriptions should be self-explanatory without requiring follow-up questions.

3. Compensation: Compensation must align with the job type and meet the following minimum hourly rates in fiat currency:
   - USD 20
   - EUR 22
   - GBP 22
   - INR 320

Compensation should include the currency type (e.g., EUR or USD). While cryptocurrency as a form of compensation is prohibited, alternative options such as stock options may be included as *supplementary* benefits, as long as the minimum rate is satisfied. Unless explicitly specified otherwise, pay periods will be assumed to correspond to a full-time schedule of an 8-hour workday and 40-hour workweek.

4. Talent Location: Talent Location must specify the location where the hire will take place with a contract, include the job poster's country, and indicate whether it's remote or on-site (e.g., "Germany, Remote Worldwide," "USA, On-Site New York City," "France, Remote Europe"). Jobs must be lawful in the specified locations.

5. Conduct: Conversations between job seekers and job posters must be professional and courteous.

6. Enforcement: Non-compliant job posts will be promptly removed, and the poster will receive a warning. Repeated violations or misuse of the job posting system will result in a ban from the platform.
