Our Job Board platform #job-postings demands that all users read, acknowledge, and abide by the following regulations to ensure a space of absolute professionalism and seriousness for all involved parties.

# Job Board Rules

**Task Based Jobs:**  
Task Based jobs typically involve small, focused tasks that can be completed within a short timeframe. For example, setting up hosting for a website or fixing styling issues on a webpage are common task based jobs. These tasks are usually relatively simple and straightforward, often requiring just a few hours to complete.

**Project-Based Work:**  
On the other hand, project-based work encompasses larger, more complex undertakings that span over several days, weeks, or even months. This type of work is typically more professional in nature and may involve hiring a freelancer to work on a specific project, such as building a web application or developing a product from scratch. Project-based work often requires a greater level of skill, expertise, and time commitment compared to task based jobs.

In summary, task based jobs are small, short-term tasks, while project-based work involves larger, longer-term projects that require a higher level of professionalism and expertise.

1. Task Based job postings must have a clear and detailed description, specifying the desired result of the task or project.
2. Task Based jobs should be limited to small tasks that can be completed within a short timeframe, such as setting up a database on a server. Project-based Task Baseds are not permitted.
3. The client and freelancer are responsible for communication and creating contracts. This server serves as a medium for advertising the job only.
4. Task Based jobs must be compensated and clearly labeled with the hourly rate, e.g., 30â‚¬/h. Only real-world currency may be used for compensation.
