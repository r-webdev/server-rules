# Freelancer Profile Rules

1. Adherence to Server Rules: It is crucial to abide by all the rules outlined in our server. Please take the time to review them under the #old-rules section.

2. Comprehensive Skills and Experience: Your profile should provide a comprehensive overview of your skills and experience. Please ensure that all relevant information is included directly in the profile and not hidden behind external links.

3. Portfolio, GitHub, and LinkedIn: You are encouraged to share your portfolio, GitHub, and LinkedIn pages, or other relevant sites, to provide additional insights into your work and professional background.

4. Promoting Freelancer Services: While using the freelancer profile, you are strictly prohibited from promoting any personal products. This platform is exclusively designed for promoting your freelance services and connecting with potential clients.

We believe that by following these guidelines, you will create a compelling profile that effectively communicates your abilities and attracts the attention of those seeking your expertise. Good luck in your freelancing journey!
