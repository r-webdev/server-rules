# üìã Our Community Policy

**Moderators will apply discretion where necessary.** While moderators will try to enforce these rules as closely as we can, no set of rules can cover every eventuality. If necessary, we will take action so that the server remains a friendly place.

You may also view our rules in the public repository: [r-webdev/server-rules](https://github.com/r-webdev/server-rules)

## Help, my message gets blocked!

If your message has been blocked, it is likely due to a violation of our community rules. We are committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone. Unfortunately, we do not disclose specific trigger words for message blocks. Please review our Community Policy to ensure compliance.

Repeated attempts to send blocked messages to circumvent the rules may result in actions taken by the moderation team.

## Rules

1. **Be respectful.** Interact in a way that builds up and encourages both the people you are communicating with and the entire server. No insulting, no bullying, no dogpiling, no name-calling, no minority discrimination. Homophobia and transphobia are especially prohibited. Failing to respect pronouns counts as transphobia. Having a "different culture" is not an excuse. If you disagree, keep your opinions to yourself or leave. Egregious violations will result in an instant ban.

2. **Follow the Discord Terms of Service (https://discord.com/terms) and Community Guidelines (https://discord.com/guidelines).** Do not discuss or advertise hacking, game cheats, modifications to the Discord app, or piracy, including in your user profile. Violations will be reported to Discord.

3. **Keep discussions limited to the most appropriate channel.** If multiple channels fit the criteria, please pick one. If you're not sure, feel free to ask. Discussions or streaming in voice chat must be relevant to that channel. All job postings must be made in the ‚Å†‚Å†job-postings channel using the Freeflow bot, follow the given ‚Å†#job-rules and ‚Å†#freelancer-profile-rules. Do not post r√©sum√©s or CVs. Repeated advertising or soliciting for work outside of ‚Å†job-postings will result in a ban. To get access you need to grab the correct role #Channels & Roles.

4. **Do not post or discuss NSFW content.** Egregious violations will result in an instant ban.

5. **Do not spam.** This includes but is not limited to: duplicate messages within the same channel, duplicate messages across more than one channel, large images, and invite links. Do not beg for help. Post your message in the most relevant channel and wait for a response. Posting invite links will result in a temporary mute.

6. **Do not self-promote without contributing to the community.** Joining the community with the purpose to promote your own project or business is disrespectful. Promotion shortly after joining or repeated promotion without community contribution will result in a ban.

7. **Do not reveal any personal information about another user.** In addition, consider what you share about yourself and what consequences sharing personal information may have.

8. **Do not DM users without prior permission.** Make sure you have explicit permission to DM a user before initiating a private conversation.

9. **Do not use inappropriate usernames.** This includes, but is not limited to: hard-to-tag names, impersonations, advertisements, offensive names, hoisting, and excessively changing your name.

10. **Do not attempt to mass tag.** This includes attempting to tag @everyone. If you believe a situation requires immediate moderator attention, you may tag the @Moderator role. If you have a non-urgent issue, please DM @üëÆ Modmail.

11. **Do not participate in academic dishonesty.** You can ask for help understanding homework but we will not complete the work for you.

12. **Do not post shortened URLs.** TypeScript Playground shortened URLs (https://tsplay-dev.vercel.app/) are exempt.

13. **Do not upload code files directly to Discord.** Utilize the /please code command to discover third-party platforms for effectively sharing your code with others.

14. **Do not DM users to avoid enforcement of these rules.**

15. **Do not discuss, share links to, or solicit work for Web3 technologies.** In light of the significant volume of Web3-related spam, we are prohibiting discussions. This includes but is not limited to: blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs.

16. **Communication must be in English.** This allows us to effectively moderate and gives everyone an opportunity to join in on the conversation.
